# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Gemini CLI Wrapper

## 1. Introduction

This repository, `gemini-langgraph-prototype`, serves as a wrapper around the existing Gemini Command Line Interface (CLI). Its primary purpose is to enhance the capabilities of the Gemini CLI by integrating advanced features such as multi-agent orchestration, persistent memory, and performance metrics.

## 2. Goals

*   **Extend Gemini CLI Functionality:** Provide a more robust and feature-rich environment for interacting with Gemini models beyond the basic CLI.
*   **Enable Complex AI Workflows:** Facilitate the creation and execution of multi-agent systems that can collaborate to solve problems.
*   **Ensure Persistent State:** Implement a memory system to maintain conversational context and agent states across interactions.
*   **Provide Performance Insights:** Offer metrics on token usage to help users understand and optimize their interactions with Gemini models.

## 3. Features

### 3.1. Multi-Agent Orchestration

*   **Description:** Allows for the definition and execution of multiple AI agents that can interact with each other in a structured workflow.
*   **Benefits:** Enables more complex problem-solving, simulates collaborative intelligence, and breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable sub-tasks handled by specialized agents.

### 3.2. Persistent Memory System

*   **Description:** Integrates a SQLite-based database to store conversational history and agent-specific states persistently.
*   **Benefits:** Maintains context across sessions, improves the coherence and relevance of agent responses over time, and allows for long-running, stateful interactions.

### 3.3. Performance Metrics (Token Usage)

*   **Description:** Tracks and reports token usage for interactions with the Gemini models.
*   **Benefits:** Provides insights into the cost and efficiency of model usage, helps in optimizing prompts, and aids in resource management.

### 3.4. Gemini CLI Integration

*   **Description:** Seamlessly wraps the existing `gemini` CLI tool, allowing all underlying model capabilities to be leveraged.
*   **Benefits:** Leverages the power of the official Gemini CLI while adding a layer of advanced features on top.

## 4. Technical Architecture (High-Level)

*   **Core Language:** JavaScript/Node.js
*   **Graph Orchestration:** LangChain's LangGraph for defining and managing agent workflows.
*   **Database:** SQLite for persistent memory storage.
*   **CLI Interaction:** Child process execution to interact with the `gemini` CLI.
*   **Tokenization:** `tiktoken` library for calculating token usage.

## 5. Future Considerations

*   **Configurability:** Allow users to easily configure agent behaviors, memory settings, and performance tracking options.
*   **Extensibility:** Design the system to easily integrate new agents, tools, and model providers.
*   **User Interface:** Consider a web-based or more interactive CLI interface for easier management and visualization of agent interactions.
*   **Advanced Metrics:** Explore additional performance metrics beyond token usage, such as latency and cost estimation.
